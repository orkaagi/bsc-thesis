# Automatic Declarer Algorithm for Bridge

In my bachelor thesis I planned and implemented an algorithm that can be used in Bridge to get an automatic declarer player. The user of my web application can play against the automatic declarer and practice defence.

For implementing the application I used the following technologies:
- MySQL (database)
- SpingBoot (backend)
- React (frontend)
- Docker (deployment)

I defended my thesis successfully and got a 5 (excellent) result in July 2025.
